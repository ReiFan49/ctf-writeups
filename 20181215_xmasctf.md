# X-MAS CTF 2018 Writeup
Team Name: SeleneWonderland, solo team.

## Misc
### Santa the Weaver
  HINT: use `strings` command

### The Ultimate Christmas Game
  - NOTE: **Requires MD5 captcha**
  - HINT: This is a Nim game, starts with nonzero sum
  - HINT: Just remember to XOR all pile sets

### A Christmas Dilemma
  1. Iterate each possible points
  2. For me, i iterate on first 5 points between min and max
  3. Get a smaller gap between values
  4. After first iteration (the first 5), check if any points are higher than the max
  5. Whenever it happens, scan around 10 points from the respective point
  6. Try focusing the deep point after several iteration loops, to make your search more sharper.
     **This may lead to inaccurate curve analysis**.
  99. You should get the **Extreme Maximum** if you waited enough

### Weird Transmission (UNFINISHED)
  1. given reversed transmission. it's clearly told from how the sound heard.
  2. he says 6 very long numbers (48-49 digits)
  3. his last hint is "incomplete equilibrium shape"
  `what should i do with 3 coordinates?`

## Reverse
### Dataflow Programming (UNFINISHED)
  i'm forfeiting this due to technical reason. will work on interpreter later.
  there are several people attempting this lazily by interpreter too.

## Web
### Our Christmas Wishlist
  HINT: the data is XML, perform XML injection for PHP with custom entity

### Reindeers and Cookies
  HINT: Problem hint mentions `cmp`, aka the check is based strcmp.
  
  - Change the main cookie key into array-ish. common attack for PHP
  - Decode the `cookiez`, and change the user id and user type to `admin`.
    (It's a 3-layered Base64 Encoded JSON)

### Super Secure Siberian Vault
  HINT: they give a strong hint about **archive processing**. However, they only accepts zip file for archive processing itself.
  1. create a php injection script and put it inside a zip
  2. edit the name inside the zip to `../../img/<filename>`
  3. execute php script from `/img` directory

### Santa's Lucky Number (UNFINISHED)
  Does the 404 page have hints?

## Forensics
### Oh Christmas Tree
  HINT: use `strings` command

### Santa's Security Levels (UNFINISHED)
  1. it's a morse code, transcode it
  2. it points to one of the staff's github repo. https://github.com/gooogal/xmas or something
  3. it's Vignere ciphere... or ROT13...

# Disclaimer
I didn't perform this well as I need some refreshing with my real life problems. Nothing more than that. If I have time, i'll look up how the challenge is. I'm pretty forgetful, perhaps some hints are missing from it.

# Note
## For any MD5 Captcha based challenges
  To be honest, i generated 400k entries of it, so i can bypass the captcha with O(1) lookup, with the risk of 60% rejected.
  Too lazy to perform it whenever requested.
